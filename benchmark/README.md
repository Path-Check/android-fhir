# Android FHIR SDK Benchmark module

Contains test cases that evaluate the performance of individual tasks executed for the first time directly on hardware. 

The test cases are designed to run in sequence of their alphabetic order to make sure larger tasks do not build cache for smaller ones. Their class names are prefixed by an extra letter to inform their position relative to others in the list.
